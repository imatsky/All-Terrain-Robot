# Project Overview

This project explores the design and simulation of an all-terrain mobile robot using ROS, with a focus on modular system architecture, reproducibility, and research-oriented documentation.

The project is developed on **Ubuntu 22.04**, targeting **ROS 2 Humble** as the primary middleware due to its long-term support and active adoption in academic research.

The objectives of this project are:
- To design a reusable robot description suitable for rough terrain
- To evaluate basic motion behavior in simulation
- To document design decisions and limitations transparently
